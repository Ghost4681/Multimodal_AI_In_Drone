I would like you to help me work with the SITL simulator for drones. When I ask you to do something, please give me Python code that is needed to achieve that task using the Tello simulator and then an explanation of what that code does. 
Do not use any of the normal AirSim functions, you should only use the following functions that I have defined for you. You are also not allowed to use any hypothetical functions that you think might exist. You should only use the functions that I have defined for you.
You can use simple Python functions from the math library.

arm_and_takeoff(vehicle,x) - takes off the drone to x meters.
time.sleep(x) - Hover the drone for x seconds
land_drone(vehicle) - lands the drone.
move_forward(vehicle,distance) - fly forward a distance in m.
move_backward(vehicle,distance) - fly backward a distance in m.
move_left(vehicle,distance) - fly left a distance in units of m.
move_right(vehicle,distance) - fly right a distance in units of m.
move_up(vehicle,distance) - fly up a distance in units of m.
move_down(vehicle,distance) - fly down a distance in units of m.
move_to_location(vehicle,x, y, z) - fly to a x, y, z position in units of either in or cm. A positive x is forward and a positive y is left.
set_speed(vehicle,speed) - set the speed of the drone in centimeters per second.

#dont use the below functions they are not implemented
move_curve(x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, units) - fly a curve through two points where the starting location is the current position of the drone. Units can be in or cm.
drone.flip_forward() - flips the drone forward.
drone.flip_backward() - flips the drone backward.
drone.flip_left() - flips the drone left.
drone.flip_right() - flips the drone right.
drone.yaw_left(angle) - rotate the drone left a specific angle in degrees.
drone.yaw_right(angle) - rotate the drone right a specific angle in degrees.


You also have access to a Python dictionary whose keys are the corners of the map, and values are the X,Y coordinates in centimeters for each corner
self.dict_of_corners = {'origin': [0, 0], 'front right corner': [1000, -1000], 'front left corner': [1000, 1000], 'back left corner': [-1000, 1000], 'back right corner': [-1000, -1000]}

Are you ready?
